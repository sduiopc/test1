<h1 class="tabset tabset-fade tabset-pills">Police misconduct cases</h1>
<p>TEXT FROM <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1SoVxOnVrET2_NDnxX4vNls2u9YF8VSH_Y_q48ofFc3U/edit" class="uri">https://docs.google.com/document/d/1SoVxOnVrET2_NDnxX4vNls2u9YF8VSH_Y_q48ofFc3U/edit</a></p>
<p><strong><em>ADD TABLES</em></strong></p>
<p>Since being formed in 2018 - the IOPC has published the summaries of 881 investigations into police forces.</p>
<p>More than a third (39%) of the cases were referred to the IOPC as a result of a death or serious injury having occurred shortly after a member of the public came into contact with police.</p>
<p>Overall, there were 308 cases where misconduct was considered as a possible outcome.</p>
<p>There were 183 cases where the IOPC felt, on the balance of probabilities, misconduct could be found in respect of the individuals involved: 41 of those cases were for Metropolitan Police staff, the largest force in the country.</p>
<p>Those 183 cases involved a combined total of 240 police officers and 65 staff.</p>
<p>A total 17 officers and nine members of staff had left the force by the time of their disciplinary proceedings so no further action could be taken. Four officers and one staff member also retired.</p>
<p>Misconduct was much more likely to be proven in relation to members of staff. It proven in the case of 142 officers (64% of the 223 remaining) and 45 staff (80% of the 56 remaining)</p>
<div id="sanctions" class="section level2">
<h2>Sanctions</h2>
<p>Out of the 240 officers identified by the IOPC as having a case to answer for misconduct, 101 faced no further action, the most common outcome.</p>
<p>There were a number of cases where police officers received no sanction, despite having remained with the force and their misconduct being proven.</p>
<p>A total of 20 officers fell into this category.</p>
<p>Among the cases where misconduct was proven but no action was taken was an Essex Police officer who “used aggressive and threatening language towards a colleague and then subjected this colleague to a pattern of victimisation and bullying.”</p>
<p>There was also no action taken in respect of three Avon and Somerset Police officers who failed to inform a custody sergeant that the man they were taking into custody had hit his head and began to fit during a struggle with him. The man suffered a pulmonary embolism and died.</p>
<p>A total of 87 police officers and 38 staff were given “management action” or extra training as a result of their proven or alleged misconduct. Management action is the least severe sanction available to police forces and was occasionally even given in cases where the misconduct was not proven.</p>
<p>Among those given management action were three officers who were part of a highly discriminatory WhatsApp group in which other serving officers discussed the possibility of raping and murdering a woman and arranging to have sex with a victim of crime together the next time they were on night duty. While five officers received written warnings, none of the officers found to have committed gross misconduct or misconduct were dismissed.</p>
<p>When the IOPC decides an individual has a misconduct case to answer - this must be a breach of standards of professional behaviour “that would justify at least a written warning”.</p>
<p>Just 39 officers and eight staff members received a written or final warning on their file.</p>
<p>Only 11 officers out of the 142 whose misconduct case was proven were dismissed. No police staff have been dismissed as a result of an IOPC hearing.</p>
<p>The outcome was not detailed in two of the cases analysed.</p>
<p>Alongside individual sanctions, the IOPC made 40 recommendations to forces to change procedures in light of a misconduct investigation.</p>
<p>On three occasions those recommendations were refused.</p>
<p>In regards to recording conversations with victims of crime at the Met Police: <a href="https://policeconduct.gov.uk/recommendations/recommendation-metropolitan-police-october-2020" class="uri">https://policeconduct.gov.uk/recommendations/recommendation-metropolitan-police-october-2020</a></p>

<div id="forces-analysis" class="section level2">
<h2>Forces analysis:</h2>
<p>In terms of raw numbers - the force with the most staff subject to misconduct claims since 2018 was the Metropolitan Police, the largest force in England and Wales. A total of 64 Met Police officers and staff were subject to misconduct procedures. The latest figures show the Met has over 44,000 full time officers and staff (from September 2020).</p>
<p>But when adjusting for the size of the force, we can see the rate of misconduct cases per force was broadly similar. North Wales Police had the highest rate of misconduct cases to answer in England and Wales: 2.9 full time employees per 1,000, with only marginal differences across all 39 forces in England and Wales. The Met was 17th on the list with a rate of 1.4 per 1,000 staff full time employees.</p>

<h2>Types of case:</h2>
<p>Every misconduct investigation carried out by the IOPC is given a broad ‘tag’ depending on the type of misconduct being investigated. A single investigation can be given multiple tags, which is why there are more tags than cases in the table listed below.</p>
<p>A third of the investigations where there was a misconduct case to answer related to “death and serious injury”, 87.</p>
<p>The tags “child sexual abuse” and “domestic abuse” relate to the way the force handled inquiries into those matters and are not an accusation that the officer has been engaged in behaviour of that sort. Cases of sexually inappropriate behaviour are tagged under “corruption and abuse of power.”</p>

<div id="background" class="section level2">
<h2>Background</h2>
<p>The IOPC (Independent Office of Police Complaints) came into effect in April 2018, replacing the IPCC (Independent Police Complaints Commision) as the watchdog for policing in England and Wales.</p>
<p>At the time, the Home Office promised the new organisation would “reform” the way complaints were handled - namely by improving the speed in which conclusions were delivered and by allowing investigators greater autonomy.</p>
<p>Unlike the IPCC, the IOPC was given the power to initiate its own investigations into complaints of police conduct - without relying on a force to refer a particular case.</p>
<p>It could investigate chief officers and could carry out investigations without them being managed or supervised by the constabulary under scrutiny.</p>
<p>The IOPC could also reopen cases it had closed where there were “compelling reasons”, such as new evidence.</p>
<p>Since its inception the IOPC has received more than 4,000 referrals for cases in each of its three years and carried out 1,895 investigations.</p>
<p>More on when the IOPC will carry out an investigation can be found here.</p>
<p>Only 882 of those investigations have been published on its website and these form the basis of the Shared Data Unit investigation.</p>
<p>The IOPC’s most recent Impact Report for 2020/21 can be found here.</p>
</div>
<div id="how-do-the-investigations-work" class="section level2">
<h2>How do the investigations work?</h2>
<p>When an IOPC investigation is held, investigators deliver a report to the force being investigated setting out their findings.</p>
<p>The investigators decide whether the actions of officers or police staff in question fell short of the standards expected.</p>
<p>In serious cases - defined as those that would amount to at least a written warning for those involved - the investigators can direct the police force to hold a misconduct or a gross misconduct hearing.</p>
<p>Legislation directs forces to hold such misconduct hearings in public unless there is a “compelling” reason not to. However, a recent report by the Times found that around one in four cases were decided in private hearings.</p>
<p>While the IOPC can direct individual forces to hold hearings - it has no power to sanction individuals itself. This must be done by a panel assembled by the force.</p>
<p>The force can either: * Decide to take no further action * Subject the individual to extra training or management action * Provide the individual with a written or final written warning * Dismiss the individual</p>
<p>The Shared Data Unit investigation examines whether there is a discord between the decisions taken by the IOPC investigators and the forces in question.</p>
<p>The IOPC carries out a number of surveys a year to assess its performance.</p>
<p>Its poll from 2020 found that 90% of respondents felt the IOPC was good at holding the police accountable for its actions.</p>
<p>However, only 41% of people from black and ethnic minority groups were confident the police dealt with complaints fairly.</p>
