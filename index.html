Police misconduct</p></h1>

<div id="what-we-found" class="section level1 tabset tabset-fade tabset-pills">
<h1 class="tabset tabset-fade tabset-pills">What we found</h1>
<p><strong>Since being formed in 2018 - the IOPC has published the summaries of 881 investigations into police forces.</strong></p>
<p>Overall, there were 308 <strong>cases</strong> where misconduct was considered as a possible outcome.</p>
<p>There were 183 cases where the IOPC felt a reasonable tribunal could find misconduct in respect of the individuals involved: 41 of those cases were for Metropolitan Police staff, the largest force in the country.</p>
<p><strong>A third (33%) of the cases were referred to the IOPC as a result of a death or serious injury having occurred shortly after a member of the public came into contact with police.</strong></p>
<p>Those 183 cases involved a combined total of <strong>240 police officers and 65 staff.</strong></p>
<p>A total <strong>17 officers and nine members of staff</strong> had left the force by the time of their disciplinary proceedings so no further action could be taken. <strong>Four officers and one staff member also retired and also faced no further action.</strong></p>
<p>Misconduct was much more likely to be proven in relation to members of staff. It was proven in the case of 142 officers (64% of the 223 who had not left the force) and 45 staff (80% of the 56 who had not left the force)</p>
<div id="whats-the-story" class="section level2">
<h2>What’s the story?</h2>
<p><strong>A woman whose brother died on the floor of a custody suite more than 20 years ago believes our latest study proves the police complaints system is still broken.</strong></p>
<p>Despite a criminal trial and two seperate watchdog reports, Janet Alder has never seen an officer punished for failing to provide care to her brother Christopher while he choked on his own blood in 1998.</p>
<p>The Shared Data Unit has found that despite two separate reforms to the police complaints watchdog since then, the Independent Office for Police Complaints (IOPC) still has limited power to punish officers and staff.</p>
<p>Miss Alder said: “Your research doesn’t surprise me one little bit - the police are still making the decision as to whether their colleagues should be prosecuted.</p>
<p>“The IOPC can only recommend things while the final decision is down to the police.”</p>
<p>Our investigation found:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Out of the 240 officers found to have a misconduct case to answer since the IOPC’s inception three-and-a-half years ago, <strong>42% have faced no further action.</strong></p></li>
<li><p>Only 5% were fired and 16% received a written warning despite the fact a misconduct case should be considered a disciplinary matter that would “warrant at least a written warning”.</p></li>
<li><p>At least 20 officers received <strong>no punishment</strong> even though their misconduct was proven by a panel assembled by their constabulary. They included an Essex Police officer who subjected a colleague “to a pattern of victimisation and bullying” and three Avon and Somerset Police officers who failed to inform a custody sergeant that the man they were taking into custody had hit his head and began to fit during a struggle. The man suffered a pulmonary embolism and died.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>A third of cases where there was a misconduct case to answer related to the <strong>death or serious injury of a civilian.</strong></p>
<p>Miss Alder is at the forefront of a growing campaign to see the IOPC reformed. While its investigators have the power to command police forces to hold misconduct hearings, it still has no say in the sanction that employee receives.</p>
<p>The most common outcome is nothing.</p>
<p>The SDU’s findings come as the Home Affairs Select Committee prepares to release a potentially damning report into the effectiveness of the IOPC.</p>
</div>
<div id="sanctions" class="section level2">
<h2>Sanctions</h2>
<p><strong>Out of the 240 officers identified by the IOPC as having a case to answer for misconduct, 101 (42%) faced no further action, the most common outcome.</strong></p>
<p>There were also a number of cases where police officers received no sanction, despite having remained with the force and their <strong>misconduct being proven.</strong></p>
<p>A total of 20 officers (8%) fell into this category.</p>
<p>Among the cases where misconduct was proven but no action was taken was an Essex Police officer who “used aggressive and threatening language towards a colleague and then subjected this colleague to a pattern of victimisation and bullying.”</p>
<p>There was also no action taken in respect of three Avon and Somerset Police officers who failed to inform a custody sergeant that the man they were taking into custody had hit his head and began to fit during a struggle with him. The man suffered a pulmonary embolism and died.</p>
<p>A total of 87 police officers and 38 staff were given “management action” or extra training as a result of their proven or alleged misconduct. Management action is the least severe sanction available to police forces- though it can take a range of forms - and was occasionally given in cases where the misconduct was not proven.</p>
<p>Among those given management action were three officers who were part of a highly discriminatory WhatsApp group in which other serving officers discussed the possibility of raping and murdering a woman and arranging to have sex with a victim of crime together the next time they were on night duty.</p>
<p><strong>While five officers received written warnings, none of the officers found to have committed gross misconduct or misconduct were dismissed.</strong></p>
<p>When the IOPC decides an individual has a misconduct case to answer - the rules state it must be a breach of standards of professional behaviour “that would justify at least a written warning”.</p>
<p><strong>Just 39 officers (16% of the total identified as having a misconduct case to answer) and eight staff members received a written or final warning on their file.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Only 11 officers were dismissed</strong>. No police staff have been dismissed as a result of an IOPC hearing.</p>
<p>The outcome was not detailed in two of the cases analysed.</p>
<p>Alongside individual sanctions, the IOPC made 40 recommendations to forces to change procedures in light of a misconduct investigation.</p>
<p>On three occasions those recommendations were refused by the force in question. These are detailed below.</p>

<div id="misconduct-rates" class="section level2">
<h2>Misconduct rates</h2>
<p>In terms of raw numbers - the force with the most staff subject to misconduct claims since 2018 was the Metropolitan Police, the largest force in England and Wales. A total of 64 Met Police officers and staff were subject to misconduct procedures. The latest figures show the Met has over 44,000 full time officers and staff (from September 2020).</p>
<p>But when adjusting for the size of the force, we can see the rate of misconduct cases per force was broadly similar.</p>
<p><strong>There was no statistically significant difference between forces</strong>. North Wales Police had the highest rate of misconduct cases to answer in England and Wales: 2.9 full time employees per 1,000, with only marginal differences across all the 39 forces in England and Wales in our study. The Met was 17th on the list with a rate of 1.4 per 1,000 staff full-time employees, but <strong>this variation can be attributed to the size of the force</strong>.</p>

<h2>Types of case</h2>
<p>Every misconduct investigation carried out by the IOPC is given a broad ‘tag’ depending on the type of misconduct being investigated. <strong>A single investigation can be given multiple tags, which is why there are more tags than cases in the table listed below.</strong></p>
<p>A third of the investigations where there was a misconduct case to answer related to “death and serious injury”, 87.</p>
<p><em>NB: The tags “child sexual abuse” and “domestic abuse” relate to the way the force handled inquiries into those matters and are not an accusation that the officer has been engaged in behaviour of that sort.

<h2>Interviews</h2>
<div id="janet-alder" class="section level3">
<h3>Janet Alder</h3>
<p><strong><em>Miss Alder is a member of the United Families and Friends Coalition (UFFC), which is a group of nearly 50 families who have lost individuals in police, psychiatric and prison custody. UFFC has been campaigning for justice for their loved ones and stricter regulation of the police since 1999.</em></strong></p>
<div id="background-to-the-interview" class="section level4">
<h4>Background to the interview:</h4>
<p>Miss Alder’s brother Christopher Alder died on April 1, 1998, shortly after being taken into police custody following a fight outside a nightclub in Hull.</p>
<p>The former paratrooper spent 11 minutes face down on the floor of Queen’s Gardens Police Station before officers attended to him. He was struggling to breathe because of blood in his airway.</p>
<p>CCTV from the time showed Mr Alder partially dressed with his trousers around his ankles .</p>
<p>An inquest into Mr Alder’s death in 2000 returned a verdict of <strong>unlawful killing</strong> and charges of manslaughter and misconduct in a public office were brought against the five officers who failed to give proper care to him in the custody suite.</p>
<p>All five were acquitted when the trial collapsed in June, 2002.</p>
<p>In 2006, an IPCC investigation by the then chair Nick Hardwick found “unwitting” racism had played a part in Mr Alder’s death. Alongside the lack of care shown to the Falklands veteran, Mr Hardwick agreed that “monkey imitation” noises could be heard from behind the police counter while Mr Alder lay dead.</p>
<p>By the time of Mr Hardwick’s IPCC report, four of the five officers had already left the force on a full pension.</p>
<p>To this date, no individual police officers or staff have been sanctioned over Christopher’s death despite the conclusion by Mr Hardwick and, in 2011, an admission by the UK Government to the European Court of Human Rights that its lack of an effective investigation into Mr Alder’s death was a violation of the convention.</p>
<p>In 2018, two further officers faced gross misconduct hearings for engaging in a surveillance operation against Miss Alder during her brother’s inquest in 2000. It was alleged the officers involved listened into private, legal conversations between Miss Alder and her barrister.</p>
<p>Both officers faced no further action after their barristers argued they were acting on orders from superiors.</p>
<p>Janet Alder launched a crowdfunding appeal to fund a separate legal challenge in 2020 after it emerged Christopher’s body had remained in a police mortuary for 11 years following his death.</p>
<p>The body the family had buried at Hull’s Northern Cemetery in 2000 was in fact that of Grace Kamara, a 77-year-old woman.</p>
<p>To this date, the IOPC is yet to reopen that case as a misconduct matter even though the organisation has the power to do so.</p>
</div>
<div id="qa" class="section level4">
<h4>Q&amp;A</h4>
<p><strong>Q: Do you remember how you reacted when you first saw the video of your brother in the custody suite?</strong></p>
<p>A: “I couldn’t believe what I was seeing - I couldn’t believe my brother was dragged in with his trousers down to his knees and thrown on the floor.</p>
<p>“All I could hear was this rasping, breathing sound. He just died on the floor of the custody suite yards away from police officers’ feet. They were there talking about charging him there with more severe charges when they should have been helping him.</p>
<p>“I had an idea like most people that they would get charged with this. I thought ‘wait until the CPS gets hold of this’.</p>
<p>“But the CPS were reluctant to charge them with anything. They initially spoke about a charge of misconduct in a public office - but to me I felt it was manslaughter. If they had helped Christopher or attempted to assist him, that’s the only time they would have known whether he could have lived or died. The CPS said they had to prove the officers acted in bad faith and whether they knew he was in that condition.</p>
<p>“There are 11 minutes of footage showing him being dragged into a custody suite, thrown on the floor and dying. There are things that I’ve seen on the video that have just been dismissed. Those things are still there, to this day.</p>
<p>“But you’ve got absolutely nobody to approach them with. You find this time and time again in many of these cases.</p>
<p>“They just ignore certain things, or just dismiss certain things, which wouldn’t be dismissed if this was an ordinary man and woman.”</p>
<p><strong>Q: A further IPCC hearing in 2018 found two officers who carried out an undercover surveillance operation on you had no case to answer. What did you make of that judgement?</strong></p>
<p>A: “I remember when I went to the disciplinary hearing, I was behind a screen. That told me nothing was going to happen.</p>
<p>“No one wanted anyone to know who these officers were and at the end they could just walk away and no one would know anything. I couldn’t see the logic in a misconduct case against the two officers and not the people that authorised the surveillance against me.</p>
<p>“It just appeared that no one was keeping them in check. They could do exactly what they wanted when they wanted.”</p>
<p><strong>Q: You initially wrote to the IOPC in the hope it would reopen the case into how your brother’s body could have remained at the mortuary. Will that happen?</strong></p>
<p>A: “The IOPC have done nothing. We found out that with Christopher’s body the police were using the body for sudden death training. We wrote to the IOPC to see whether they would investigate it and they sent it back to the police to investigate themselves.</p>
<p>“The police that were investigating Christpher’s body in the mortuary then failed to do the right thing. I’ve got no confidence to approach the IOPC again. They cannot find the evidence to hold anyone to account.”</p>
<p><strong>Q: You were part of the campaign to see the IPCC reformed - how do you feel about its successor the IOPC and whether it has achieved any of the goals it set out to achieve?</strong></p>
<p>A: “Well each change of the police complaints system we’ve found has just been a cosmetic change. It is still police officers investigating police officers for a start.</p>
<p>“They still haven’t got the powers to compel people to answer questions, it’s normally on a voluntary basis and they still haven’t got the power to do anything else but recommend and put recommendations across.</p>
<p>“When would you ever get a criminal investigation where the defendant is investigating themselves or making the decision about what sentence they’re going to give themselves?</p>
<p>“It just happens in this situation - there’s no independence there.”</p>
<p><strong>Q: Where do you go now with your fight for justice?</strong></p>
<p>A: “What’s more important to me is to be able to live with myself.</p>
<p>“What they’ve done to Christopher and my family is absolutely appalling.</p>
<p>“I’m now attempting to take out civil proceedings against South Yorkshire Police who were supposed to thoroughly investigate and find out who swapped Christopher’s body and what went on in the mortuary.</p>
<p>“I’m not prepared to just walk away, justice is there for everyone and I have to remain faithful to that.”</p>
<p><strong>Q: How can the IOPC reform?</strong></p>
<p>A: “Well, I think they shouldn’t be hiring former police officers. Many of the families that have gone through this have had to investigate what’s going on with their loved ones, because the investigations have not been done thoroughly.</p>
<p>“There are ordinary people out there that are capable of asking logical questions, people can be trained properly to do independent investigations.</p>
<p>“I think it should be a totally independent body and politically it shouldn’t be constrained in any way.”</p>
<p><strong>Q: When you look at our findings and when you see that 42% of police officers found to have a misconduct case to answer faced no further action, does that surprise you?</strong></p>
<p>“Your research doesn’t surprise me one little bit - the police are making the decision to whether their colleagues should be prosecuted. The IOPC can only recommend things while the final decision is down to the police.”</p>
<p><strong>Q: Do you think there is now a growing sense that the police complaints system has been inadequate - and do you think there is political will to improve that?</strong></p>
<p>“Among the general public there is a lot more will - look at the reaction to the Bibaa Henry and Nicole Smallman cases or with Sarah Everard.</p>
<p>“The general public want some kind of independence, but I don’t think we have the political will to do it. I don’t think the politicians have the guts to attack the police or the Police Federation.”</p>

<div id="qa-1" class="section level4">
<h4>Q&amp;A</h4>
<p><strong>Q: What did you make of the Shared Data Unit’s findings?</strong></p>
<p>A: “If we go back historically to when we first started working around this issue, which was around the early 90s really, at that time there was the Police Complaints Authority (PCA), which was basically an internal investigation system.</p>
<p>“It’s a very similar state of affairs to where we are now with the IOPC, which has again shown an absolute failure to investigate things properly and the family is not allowed to be part of the process.</p>
<p>“We are still in a situation where the State controls the investigation, the State controls the outcomes, the State controls the legal process and there’s no actual independence or external monitoring of this other than from the families themselves.</p>
<p>“The only meaningful measure of whether the IOPC has been effective is - whether their work has in any way been successfully used to prosecute a police officer for use of violence and the answer is no.</p>
<p>“There’s never been a situation where the work of the PCA, IOPC has been taken to an inquest and that has resulted in a successful prosecution.</p>
<p>“The only three prosecutions that we’ve had as a result of a death of a member of the public have been in the cases of Sarah Everard, Dalian Atkinson and Henry Foley, which was a case from the 1980s.</p>
<p>“Apart from that there’s been over 2,000 documented deaths at the hands of the police and only three prosecutions. The PCA, the IPCC and the IOPC are a fundamental part of the failure of the State to hold officers to account.</p>
<p>“The data you have really supports what the families have been saying for a long time which is that the system is broken.”</p>
<p><strong>Q: Quite often the IOPC will find there is a misconduct case to answer and will hand a file to the Crown Prosecution Service, but convictions are, as you say, rare. Why do you think that is?</strong></p>
<p>A: “I think one of the issues is regarding the actual investigation because when somebody dies after coming into contact with police it’s not identified as a scene of crime. Yet if a member of the public were to use violence against somebody else it would be immediately classified as a suspected murder or manslaughter or whatever.</p>
<p>“The IOPC are sometimes called into the situation very late and we’ve had cases in the past where the IPCC has been prevented from investigating, as we saw in the case of John Charles De Menezes.</p>
<p>“However, I would have to say, just in terms of the CPS itself is that when there is public pressure to prosecute they are forced to make that move - as we saw with the case of Sarah Everard, as we saw with the case of Dailian Atkinson. But that is more of a political decision born out of public pressure.</p>
<p>“The control mechanisms, the IOPC and the CPS, are not really there to give individual justice to families - they are there to protect the image of the police which they value more than the right for life.</p>
<p><strong>Q: If you were called to give evidence at the Home Affairs Select Committee as part of its report into the IOPC what would you say? How can it improve?</strong></p>
<p>A: “Well, I wouldn’t go to the committee to be quite honest with you, because I think every committee we’ve had so far and every investigation, if you look at the data.</p>
<p>“We have to bear in mind that we’ve had now three separate organisations which have all been subject to a review - they have all been looked at by the select committee; they’ve all had so-called independent judges looking as them - there are several cases where coroners have made recommendations for changing changes in the system.</p>
<p>“It’s just a talking shop and nothing more, they have no interest whatsoever in investigating these cases properly because there is no political will to do that.”</p>

<h2>Background</h2>
<p><strong>The IOPC (Independent Office for Police Conduct) came into effect in April 2018, replacing the IPCC (Independent Police Complaints Commision) as the watchdog for policing in England and Wales.</strong></p>
<p>At the time, the Home Office promised the new organisation would reform the way complaints were handled - namely by improving the speed in which conclusions were given and by allowing investigators greater autonomy.</p>
<p>Unlike the IPCC, the IOPC was given the power to initiate its own investigations into complaints of police conduct - without relying on a force to refer a particular case.</p>
<p>It could investigate chief officers and carry out investigations without them being managed or supervised by the constabulary under scrutiny.</p>
<p>The IOPC could also reopen cases it had closed where there were “compelling reasons”, such as new evidence.</p>
<p>Since its inception the IOPC has received more than 4,000 referrals for cases in each of its three years and carried out 1,895 investigations.</p>
<p><strong>Only 881 of those investigations <a href="https://policeconduct.gov.uk/">have been published on its website</a> and these form the basis of the Shared Data Unit investigation.</strong></p>

<div id="how-do-the-investigations-work" class="section level2">
<h2>How do the investigations work?</h2>
<p>While most police complaints are dealt with by the force itself, the most serious cases are referred to the IOPC. This is either done by the force in question or the IOPC itself, which can call in an investigation if it has not been referred to by the force.</p>
<p>A member of the public can also complain directly to the IOPC. The organisation is called in automatically if an individual has died shortly after coming into contact with police.</p>
<p>Once initiated, the investigators will compile evidence to decide whether the actions of the officers or police staff in question fell short of the standards expected.</p>
<p>The investigators can require officers or staff to attend interviews - however, those under question can choose to provide a written response.</p>
<p>In serious cases - defined as those that would amount to “at least a written warning” for those involved - the investigators can direct the police force to hold a <a href="https://www.polfed.org/WestMids/advice-regs/misconduct/">misconduct</a> or a gross misconduct hearing.</p>
<p>Home Office <a href="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/895928/Home_Office_Guidance_on_Police_Misconduct.pdf">legislation states</a> “Effort should be made to ensure as much of a hearing is held in public as possible.”</p>
<p>However, <a href="https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/scores-of-rogue-officers-punished-in-secret-hearings-nzgnh68lx">a recent report by the Times</a> found that around one in four cases were decided in private hearings.</p>
<p>While the IOPC can direct individual forces to hold hearings - <strong>it has no power to sanction individuals itself</strong>. This must be done by a panel assembled by the force.</p>
<p>The force can either: * Decide to take no further action * Subject the individual to extra training or management action * Provide the individual with a written or final written warning * Dismiss the individual</p>
<p>The report returned by the IOPC will decide whether an individual or individuals have a misconduct “case to answer”. The legal test used is whether the IOPC believes that a “reasonable” tribunal would find misconduct in respect of those persons.</p>
<p><strong>The Shared Data Unit investigation examines whether there is a discord between the decisions taken by the IOPC investigators and the forces in question in the What we Found section.</strong></p>

<div id="criticism" class="section level2">
<h2>Criticism</h2>
<p>The IPCC was folded in 2018 following a number of high-profile failings, notably in its handling of the deaths of Ian Tomlinson, Sean Rigg and <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/london/4755333.stm">John Charles de Menezes</a>.</p>
<p>A report by the Home Affairs Select Committee in 2012 found the organisation was under-resourced.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Compared with the might of the 43 police forces in England and Wales, the IPCC is woefully under-equipped and hamstrung in achieving its original objectives. It has neither the powers nor the resources that it needs to get to the truth when the integrity of the police is in doubt. Smaller even than the Professional Standards Department of the Metropolitan Police, the Commission is not even first among equals, yet it is meant to be the backstop of the system. It lacks the investigative resources necessary to get to the truth; police forces are too often left to investigate themselves; and the voice of the IPCC does not have binding authority. The Commission must bring the police complaints system up to scratch and the Government must give it the powers that it needs to do so. (Paragraph 5).”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>But there are questions as to whether its replacement, the IOPC, has fulfilled its objective to improve the speed of investigations, make them more independent and improve justice.</p>
<p>In February this year, former High Court judge Sir Richard Henriques wrote an open letter to Home Secretary Priti Patel saying the IOPC’s failure to hold any officers to account over the <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-49048972">‘Nick’ scandal</a> condoned “police criminality”.</p>
<p>The Home Affairs Select Committee launched a new inquiry into the effectiveness of the IOPC at the start of 2021.</p>
<p>Evidence given to the committee so far has been highly critical.</p>
<p>Deborah Coles, executive director of INQUEST, spoke at the first hearing in January. The charity provides expertise on state-related deaths and their investigation.</p>
<p>She told the committee:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“We have seen at INQUEST repeated deaths in similar circumstances, many raising very serious questions about excessive and unlawful use of force or serious neglect. Yet disciplinary or criminal charges and sanctions against police officers are extremely rare. Sanctions should play a key role in upholding professional standards and confidence in policing. It is important to point out that there has never been a successful prosecution of any police officer for murder or manslaughter and, even where misconduct proceedings are held, sanctions too often fail to reflect the gravity of ill treatment. This sends out a message, I think, that somehow these deaths don’t matter, and also points to a police complaints system that is not capable of doing its job.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>INQUEST <a href="https://www.inquest.org.uk/deaths-in-police-custody">has been keeping a tally of the number of people who have died “in police custody or following other forms of contact with the police, as well as vehicular pursuits and road traffic incidents (RTIs)” since 1990</a>. There have been 1,800 to date, but only one serving officer, PC Benjamin Monk, has been convicted of manslaughter since 1990 for an offence carried out in the line of duty. Monk <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-shropshire-57603091">tasered former footballer Dalian Atkinson to the ground in 2016 before kicking him twice in the head</a>.</p>
<p>The IOPC carries out a number of surveys a year to assess its performance.</p>
<p>Its poll from 2020 found that 90% of respondents felt the IOPC was good at holding the police accountable for its actions.</p>
<p>However, only 41% of people from black and ethnic minority groups were confident the police dealt with complaints fairly.</p>
